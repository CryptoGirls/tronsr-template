CryptoGirls is planning to support TRON community by donating 50% of the total rewards as follows:
- 45% directly to our voters
- 2.5% for initiatives that come in need for the TRON project and community such as organizing livestreams and meetups, developing useful tools for the project and other contributions regarding TRON
- 2.5% for organizing our own meetups and hackathons.
These percentages will be periodically reviewed based on TRON price. We will be transparent with the TRON community and we will announce this kind of changes early enough.
