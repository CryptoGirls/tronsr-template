CryptoGirls is planning to support TRON community by donating 75% of the total rewards as follows:
- 70% directly to our voters
- 2.5% for initiatives that come in need for the TRON project and community such as organizing livestreams and meetups, developing useful tools for the project and other contributions regarding TRON
- 2.5% for organizing our own meetups and hackathons.

These percentages will be periodically reviewed based on TRON price. We will be transparent with the TRON community and we will announce this kind of changes early enough.

Furthermore, we plan to integrate the most important events and stats regarding TRON into a complete dashboard fully open within the community where people can track the most important TRON metrics such as ranks, votes, pools and many more.

As for the local and international community, CryptoGirls will invest in organizing events, meetups, workshops for developers to increase the awareness of blockchain technology in Romania and Europe and to further develop tools and applications to help and grow the industry.
