During the first month of producing blocks as a TRON SR, CryptoGirls will comply with the recommended configuration of the main and backup servers:

- 2 X Aws x1.16xlarge 64 cores 1T RAM 1T SSD 25Gbps Network

As well, to ensure security and stability our servers will have failover scripts and Anti-DdoS.

We will add another m5.xlarge testable node and expand it to higher configuration after 2 months.

After that, we will continuously invest into hardware expansion and we expect to have x1e.32xlarge as main servers by the end of July 2018.

We also plan to add backup nodes to the main server in different regions in the world.
