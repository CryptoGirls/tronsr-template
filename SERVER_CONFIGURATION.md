Our servers configuration before 26th June:

- Main node: 20 cores/40 threads 256GB RAM 2x2TB 25Gbps Network located in Germany

- Backup nodes: 2 x 4 cores 128GB RAM 2x2TB 25Gbps Network located in Germany

- Testable node: 4 cores 6GB RAM 30GB SSD 10Gbps Network located in United Kingdom

During the first month of producing blocks as a TRON SR, CryptoGirls will comply with the recommended configuration of the main server and periodically add nodes to directly participate in ensuring the stability of the network. 

Our servers will have failover scripts and Anti-DdoS.

After that, we will continuously invest into hardware expansion and we plan to add backup nodes to the main server in different regions in the world.
