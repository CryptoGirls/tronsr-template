Our expenditure budget before 26th June was 21k$, which includes hardware expenses for testable and main nodes, administration and organizing our first meetup.

After 26th June we planned our rewards distribution as follows:
- 70% Rewards to our voters
- 10% Servers cost & Maintanance
- 15% Administration (Team funds, legal expenses and other costs)
- 2.5% Community projects
- 2.5% Organising our events

These percentages will be periodically reviewed based on TRX price. We will be transparent with the TRON community and we will announce this kind of changes early enough.
