Our rewards distribution is as follows:
- 70% rewards to our voters. Here voters can check their pending rewards at the end of the voting rounds (every 6 hours): https://www.cryptogirls.ro/stats.html
- 30% Servers cost & Maintenance & Administration (Team funds, legal expenses and other costs)

These percentages will be periodically reviewed based on TRX price. We will be transparent with the TRON community and we will announce this kind of changes early enough.

Our expenditure budget before 26th June was 21k$, which includes hardware expenses for testable and main nodes, administration and organizing our first meetup.
