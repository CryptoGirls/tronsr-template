Our expenditure budget before 26th June was 21k$, which includes hardware expenses for testable and main nodes, administration and organizing our first meetup.

Beginning with 26th June our rewards distribution is as follows:
- 70% Rewards to our voters - daily payments made through our own developed script open-source for everyone to use: https://github.com/CryptoGirls/trx-pool

  Here voters can check their pending rewards at the end of the voting rounds (every 6 hours): https://www.cryptogirls.ro/stats.html

  Payments will be made every day!
- 10% Servers cost & Maintanance
- 15% Administration (Team funds, legal expenses and other costs)
- 2.5% Community projects
- 2.5% Organising our events

These percentages will be periodically reviewed based on TRX price. We will be transparent with the TRON community and we will announce this kind of changes early enough.
