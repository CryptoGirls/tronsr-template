Our estimated expenditure budget before 26th June is 25k$, which includes hardware expenses for testable and main nodes, administration and organizing our first meetup.

After 26th June we planned our rewards distribution as follows:
- 70% Rewards to our voters
- 10% Servers cost & Maintanance
- 15% Administration (Team funds, legal expenses and other costs)
- 2.5% Community projects
- 2.5% Organising our events

The rewards distribution above was made based on current price (1 TRX = 0.07$). These percentages will be periodically reviewed based on TRX price. We will be transparent with the TRON community and we will announce this kind of changes early enough.
