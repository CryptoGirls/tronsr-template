Beginning with 10th November our rewards distribution changed and it will remain as follows by the end of the year:
- 85% rewards to our voters. Here voters can check their pending rewards at the end of the voting rounds (every 6 hours): https://www.cryptogirls.ro/stats.html
- 15% Servers cost & Maintenance & Administration (Team funds, legal expenses and other costs)

These percentages will be periodically reviewed based on TRX price. We will be transparent with the TRON community and we will announce this kind of changes early enough.

Our expenditure budget before 26th June was 21k$, which includes hardware expenses for testable and main nodes, administration and organizing our first meetup.

From 26th June to 10th November our rewards distribution was as follows:
- 70% Rewards to our voters - daily payments made through our own developed script open-source for everyone to use: https://github.com/CryptoGirls/trx-pool
- 30% Servers cost & Maintenance & Administration (Team funds, legal expenses and other costs)
